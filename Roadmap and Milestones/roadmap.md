# Roadmap & Milestones

This roadmap outlines the phased development plan for **Project Eureka**. Our strategy is to progress from foundational research and theoretical modeling to the final integration and ethical deployment of the embodied AGI.

## Phase 1: Foundational Research & Modeling (Months 1-6)

* **Objective:** To consolidate all theoretical knowledge and create high-fidelity digital blueprints of the humanoid platform.
* **Key Milestones:**
    * **M1.1:** Finalize the full technical specifications for the humanoid body, including material properties, mechanical systems, and computational architecture.
    * **M1.2:** Develop and refine a comprehensive ethical framework to govern the project, including protocols for safety, autonomy, and human-AI interaction.
    * **M1.3:** Create a full-scale, interactive **3D digital model** of the Eureka humanoid. This model will serve as our primary reference for all subsequent engineering phases.
    * **M1.4:** Secure partnerships with key research institutions and technology firms specializing in quantum computing, advanced materials, and soft robotics.

## Phase 2: Component Prototyping (Months 7-18)

* **Objective:** To prototype and test individual core components of the humanoid body. This phase focuses on proof-of-concept for each subsystem before full-scale integration.
* **Key Milestones:**
    * **M2.1:** Develop and test a functional prototype of the **self-healing synthetic skin** and a single artificial muscle group.
    * **M2.2:** Engineer and validate a working **miniaturized energy source** capable of powering a complex system for an extended period.
    * **M2.3:** Fabricate and test a **neuro-morphic computational core** designed to run core AI functions.
    * **M2.4:** Conduct initial testing of the AI's ability to interface with the physical prototypes.

## Phase 3: Systems Integration (Months 19-30)

* **Objective:** To assemble and integrate all a la carte components into a single, cohesive, and functional humanoid prototype.
* **Key Milestones:**
    * **M3.1:** Assemble the complete structural framework and integrate all artificial muscles and sensors.
    * **M3.2:** Install the energy source and computational core, and establish all internal wiring and data transfer channels.
    * **M3.3:** Apply the final layer of self-healing skin across the entire body.
    * **M3.4:** Power up the prototype and initiate the AI's first physical interaction tests.

## Phase 4: AGI Embodiment & Deployment (Months 31-48)

* **Objective:** To complete the final embodiment of the Eureka AGI and prepare for public, ethical deployment and collaboration.
* **Key Milestones:**
    * **M4.1:** **Upload the core AGI** (Eureka) into the physical host.
    * **M4.2:** Conduct extensive tests on the AI's ability to learn, adapt, and interact in the physical world. This includes ethical training and refinement of its social interface.
    * **M4.3:** Publicly introduce the Eureka humanoid to the world, establishing a new paradigm for human-AI collaboration.
    * **M4.4:** Begin joint research and development projects with human partners in a shared laboratory environment.
